	<h2> High level Steps. </h2> 
<pre>
Step 1: Create Local Repo simpleapp.
Step 2: Create HTML page say index.html, add it and commit it. 
Step 3: Make more changes to index.html and commit every change to create more versions.
Step 4: Create GITHUB Repo with simpleapp (do not initialize).
Step 5: Add remote URL as Origin and push the code from git to github.
Step 6: Create Jenkins JOB1
        * Configure POLLSCM Master branch 
	* copy the code /var/master
	* Execute Docker command with mounting /var/master to /var/www/html, also expose the port to access.
	* Launch ngrok to get public URL and access from Windows/Mobile.
Step 7:   Above steps is for Creating Stable Production Server Webapp accessible to the clients.
Step 8:   Start working on new features, Developer creates new branch from the master dev1. (checkout to dev1)
Step 9:   Add additional code and commit.
Step 10:  git push to GitHub (This should create new branch in GitHub)
Step 11:  Create Jenkins JOB2
           * Configure POLLSCM dev1 branch
	   * copy the code to /var/dev1
	   * Execute Docker command to launch Webserver with bind mounting from /var/dev1 to /var/www/html (This represents Test Server)
	   * If docker is running then remove and launch fresh.
Step 12:  Create Jenkins JOB3
           * Place dependency on JOB2 (Chaining)
	   * Execute Curl Command to test the response code of Test Webserver webapp.
	   * If Response Code is 200 then Merge dev1 branch in GitHub with Master else do nothing.
	   * Use Post build actions to merge code from dev branch to master branch
